       The cold war was one of the most culturally important periods of recent American and Russian history, and has much defined half of what we think of 20th century culture in many different ways. And much of that war was fought not with bombs and bullets but through the use of propaganda, and design played a huge role in shaping the public opinion on both sides. In this exhibition, we will explore how the graphic design was developed and evolved throughout the Cold War on both sides of the war. By examining the cultural and societal context of which these designs were created, we can reveal the methods and cultural motifs behind these works of state propaganda, including their influences on each other and impact on society.
