      <h2>A message from the Senior Class</h2>
      <p>
        Honestly, we’re not sure what’s felt longer: the past four years or the
        past few months. What we are sure of is that not being able to celebrate
        in-person does not diminish our sense of pride in how far we have come
        since our first day here at Drexel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our time in the Graphic Design program has certainly been memorable.
        Between all the accidental cuts and sleep-deprived rants, we have
        learned new techniques, problem-solving skills, and the importance of
        continuous iteration. Many of us will not only graduate with a resume
        and portfolio, but with an eagerness to improve the world around us, a
        willingness to take on any challenge, and above all, a network of
        talented designers we are lucky enough to also call our friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to thank our families, friends, teachers, and supporters for the
        endless encouragement and tough love that helped us get to where we are
        today. We are grateful for your support and excited to share our work
        with you.
      </p>
