Here, we can see the Cubist and European Modernism influence coming through strongly through the bold composition and decisive choice of colors. Most likely inspired by the like of famous painter and designer A. J. Cassandre, this design employs stylized geometric forms in flat bold colors to create a strong sense of structure and unity. The emphasis on the imposing and dominating shape of the carrier—as well as its center position in the layout—reminds the viewer of the military strength and technological advantages of the U.S Navy.\n","additional_info":[{"id":1,"text":"Unframed Dimensions 27H X 19W"}],"Country":"US","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.7013698630136986,"src":"/static/1afc6e39cfffd17bd34318e7bf422a13/53a4d/b48ebec38397364202be6e433c66226e.jpg","srcSet":"/static/1afc6e39cfffd17bd34318e7bf422a13/781b9/b48ebec38397364202be6e433c66226e.jpg 512w,\n/static/1afc6e39cfffd17bd34318e7bf422a13/53a4d/b48ebec38397364202be6e433c66226e.jpg 898w","sizes":"(max-width: 898px) 100vw, 898px"}}}},{"id":"Artworks_2","Title":"Untitled","Designer":"NSA, FOIA Case#83661","Date":"c.1950 — c.1970","Description":"This poster is part of a National Security campaign initiated by the NSA during 1950s in an effort to combat Communist influence during the Cold War. The underlying text is borrowed from the famous speech made by President Lincoln during the Gettysburg Address, which is rendered in traditional serif typeface to instill austerity and historical importance. This is contrasted by the blood-like graffiti overlaid on top of it. The crossing of “under god\" most likely references the anti-religion policy of the USSR, while the replacing of “people” with ‘state\" is a reference to the perceived oppression of the Soviet government on its people. This is reflective of the collectivist agenda often found in USSR's propaganda which emphasizes collective good (in this case the benefits of the “State\") over individual's (or “People's”) benefits. As this campaign was targeted at U.S officials, this message about the USSR and its extreme oppressive policies serves as a cautionary tale about the US's opposition in the Cold War. This also shed some light on the general attitude toward the USSR during this tenuous period of the Cold War.","additional_info":[],"Country":"US","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.7816793893129771,"src":"/static/d0e68a670e7c2be3460895b012a133cd/0b948/bb27841fd603d3e2ee2c417a11790d21.png","srcSet":"/static/d0e68a670e7c2be3460895b012a133cd/d9e4b/bb27841fd603d3e2ee2c417a11790d21.png 512w,\n/static/d0e68a670e7c2be3460895b012a133cd/5825a/bb27841fd603d3e2ee2c417a11790d21.png 1024w,\n/static/d0e68a670e7c2be3460895b012a133cd/0b948/bb27841fd603d3e2ee2c417a11790d21.png 2048w,\n/static/d0e68a670e7c2be3460895b012a133cd/b1157/bb27841fd603d3e2ee2c417a11790d21.png 2363w","sizes":"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"}}}},{"id":"Artworks_3","Title":"Mrs. Behind the Missile","Designer":"Scientific American","Date":"1958","Description":"How do you advertise to hire a long-range missile designer during the Cold War?

With the gold Olympic medals as the background, this poster features a tall, muscular, idealized version of the USSR athlete, almost in parallel to the image of ‘Superman' or superheroes most commonly found in American media at the time. The classical painterly technique used to render this central figure, along with the bold thick-stroke typography, reinforces a sense of national pride and confidence. This also helps elevate and establish the status of the USSR athletes to that of heroes and mythical legends.","additional_info":[{"id":8,"text":"Printed Poster"}],"Country":"USSR","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.7020280811232449,"src":"/static/a97342e5ade3480215bc1b8b57016ad9/6db3c/5fca00705df9261ee804952876c3048e.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a97342e5ade3480215bc1b8b57016ad9/6db3c/5fca00705df9261ee804952876c3048e.jpg 450w","sizes":"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"}}}},{"id":"Artworks_9","Title":"\"I wouldn't suggest using force Mr. Reagan\"","Designer":"Unknown","Date":"1980","Description":"This poster was created by the USSR as a critical response to the US's Reagan reform in 1980s.
