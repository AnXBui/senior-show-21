Here, we can see the Cubist and European Modernism influence coming through strongly through the composition and choice of color. Most likely inspired by the like of famous painter A.J.Cassandre, this design employs stylized geometric forms in flat bold colors to create a strong sense of structure and unity. The emphasis on the imposing shape of the carrier—as well as its center position in the layout—reminds the viewer of the strength of the U.S navy force and technological advantage. \n","additional_info":[{"id":1,"text":"Unframed Dimensions 27H X 19W"}],"Country":"US","Image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/1afc6e39cfffd17bd34318e7bf422a13/14b42/b48ebec38397364202be6e433c66226e.jpg"}}}},{"id":"Artworks_2","Title":"Untitled","Designer":"NSA, FOIA Case#83661","Date":"c.1950 — c.1970","Description":"This poster is part of a National Security campaign initiated by the NSA during 1950s in an effort to combat Communism during the Cold War. The underlying text is borrowed from the famous speech made by President Lincoln during the Gettysburg Address, which is rendered in traditional serif typefaces to instill austerity. This is contrasted by the blood-like graffiti overlayed on top of it. The crossing of “under god\" most likely reference the anti-religion policy of the USSR, while the replacing of “people” with ‘state\" is a reference to the oppression on the USSR government on its people. As this campaign was targeted at U.S officials, this message about the USSR and its extreme oppressive policy serves as a cautionary tale about the opposition of the Cold War. his also shed some light on the general attitude toward the USSR during this tenuous period of the Cold War.\n","additional_info":[],"Country":"US","Image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/d0e68a670e7c2be3460895b012a133cd/ee604/bb27841fd603d3e2ee2c417a11790d21.png"}}}}]}}}
